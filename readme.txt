== Description ==

The <strong>Pinoy Pop Up on Exit</strong> was developed to provide solely ONE purpose: <strong><em>Increase Sales and Leads by 300%!</em></strong>

This plugin is mainly for sales copy sites, opt-in(squeeze) pages, upsell offers page or any page that tries to bribe people to stay in the page to respond to an offer.

If a visitor tries to exit your site(page/post) they will instead see a popup screen providing them with an incentive not to leave. This incentive could be a discount or a bonus if they choose not to leave and instead make a purchase.

A working example of this script is at [Publishing a Book](http://www.publishingabook.com "Book Publishing Made Easy") and [Paid Public Speaker](http://www.paidpublicspeaker.com "Public Speaking Made Easy").
